# Assignment-16|| Data-Journalism-and-D3
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates.The main task is with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.


I did created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as : Smokes vs. Age.

Using the D3 techniques , created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I have coded this graphic in the app.js file of my homework directory. I pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. The scatter plot did  ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

      * Include state abbreviations in the circles.

      * Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

Note: I did use python -m http-server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
